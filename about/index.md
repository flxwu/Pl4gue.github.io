Currently, I am diving into the deep world of Android programming. Java is my main programming language, but I do also master Python and a bit of Kotlin, C++ and C#.

I offer my software development services, alongside with flawless and high-quality transcription, translation and writing services on **<a href="https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~01d2548e2afe99f870/"><b>UpWork</b></a>.**
